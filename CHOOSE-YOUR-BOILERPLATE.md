# Project-Specific vs Generic Boilerplate
## How to Choose and When to Use Each

---

## 📌 Quick Summary

| Aspect | Generic | Project-Specific |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Use For** | Any app (blog, todo, store, etc.) | NoCodeLab training platform |
| **Examples** | "Item", "Post", "Product", "Todo" | "Course", "Student", "PRD", "Certificate" |
| **Setup Time** | Requires customization (~1 hour) | Ready to use (~10 min) |
| **Learning Curve** | Better for learning patterns | Faster if building similar project |
| **Flexibility** | Highly adaptable | Less flexible |
| **Best For** | New project types | Training platforms & education apps |

---

## 🎯 Choose Generic When...

✅ Building a **NEW TYPE** of app
- Todo app
- Blog platform
- E-commerce store
- Social media app
- Project management tool
- Anything NOT a training platform

✅ Want to **LEARN** the pattern
- Understand architecture deeply
- See how to adapt for your needs
- Build from first principles

✅ Building for a **DIFFERENT CLIENT/TEAM**
- They have different business logic
- They need different data models
- They have different roles/features

✅ Want **MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY**
- Customize for your exact needs
- Not constrained by existing structure
- Can evolve easily

---

## 🎯 Choose Project-Specific When...

✅ Building a **TRAINING PLATFORM** like NoCodeLab
- Students taking courses
- Trainers managing sessions
- AI PRD generation
- Certificate management
- Certification quizzes

✅ Building something **VERY SIMILAR** to existing project
- Same business logic
- Same user roles (student, trainer, admin)
- Same core features

✅ Want to **LEARN FROM REAL EXAMPLE**
- See complete feature implementation
- Understand complex business logic
- Study how everything connects

✅ Want to **START CODING IMMEDIATELY**
- Already have all structure set up
- Just copy and modify
- No adaptation needed

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Element | Generic | Project-Specific |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Main Entity** | "Item" (generic) | "Course" (specific) |
| **Roles** | Generic User/Admin | Student/Trainer/Admin |
| **Folders** | `components/features/` | `components/student/`, `components/trainer/` |
| **Naming** | `useItems.ts` | `useStudentCourses.ts` |
| **Database** | Generic tables | Specific schema (courses, sessions, etc.) |
| **Business Logic** | Minimal | Comprehensive (AI integration, billing, etc.) |
| **Examples** | Generic patterns | Real-world scenarios |
| **Setup** | 1-2 hours | 10-15 minutes |
| **Customization** | Lots needed | Minimal needed |

## 🔄 When to Switch

### Start Generic, Become Project-Specific?

**If you're building a training platform:**
1. Start with Generic Boilerplate
2. Rename to your specific terms
3. It becomes Project-Specific for YOUR app
4. Example: Rename "Item" → "Course" throughout
5. Result: Your custom Project-Specific boilerplate

### Start Project-Specific, Learn Generic?

**If you're learning architecture:**
1. Study Project-Specific (see real examples)
2. Read Generic version (understand patterns)
3. Build your own generic version
4. Adapt it to your app

---

## 🎯 Decision Tree

```
START HERE: "What am I building?"

├─ "A blog/todo/store/social/etc."
│  └─ Use GENERIC ✅
│     └─ Follow ADAPTATION-GUIDE.md
│
├─ "A training platform like NoCodeLab"
│  └─ Use PROJECT-SPECIFIC ✅
│     └─ Copy and customize for your platform
│
└─ "Something else similar to an existing project"
   └─ Ask yourself:
      ├─ Same user roles? (student, trainer, admin)
      ├─ Same business logic?
      ├─ Same data model?
      └─ If YES to all: Use PROJECT-SPECIFIC ✅
      └─ If NO to any: Use GENERIC + ADAPTATION-GUIDE ✅
```

## 🔀 Converting Between Them

### Generic → Project-Specific (Your App)

**Example: Turn Generic into a Blog**

```
Generic                    Blog-Specific
Item.tsx                   Post.tsx
ItemList.tsx              → PostList.tsx
useItems.ts               → usePosts.ts
itemService.ts            → postService.ts
items table               → posts table
```

**Time needed:** ~1 hour

### Project-Specific → Generic (Learning)

**Example: Generalize the Training Platform**

```
Project-Specific           Generic Version
Course.tsx                 Item.tsx
Student → User
Trainer → User (with role)
Session → Feature/Event
```

**Time needed:** ~2 hours

## ✅ Checklist: Which Should I Use?

```
Question 1: What am I building?
[ ] Blog/CMS/Media → Use GENERIC
[ ] Todo app → Use GENERIC
[ ] E-commerce store → Use GENERIC
[ ] Social media → Use GENERIC
[ ] Project management → Use GENERIC
[ ] Training platform → Use PROJECT-SPECIFIC

[ ] Portfolio site → Use GENERIC
[ ] Something else? → Use GENERIC (safer)

Question 2: Do I need role-based access?
[ ] Different roles (student, trainer, admin) → PROJECT-SPECIFIC
[ ] Just user/admin → GENERIC
[ ] Multiple entity types with different permissions → PROJECT-SPECIFIC

Question 3: How much time do I have?
[ ] Less than 1 hour to setup → PROJECT-SPECIFIC
[ ] 1-2 hours available → GENERIC
[ ] Plenty of time for learning → GENERIC

RESULT:
- If mostly GENERIC → Use GENERIC
- If mostly PROJECT-SPECIFIC → Use PROJECT-SPECIFIC
- If confused → Use GENERIC (more flexible)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

**If you choose Generic:**
→ Read [GENERIC-BOILERPLATE-README.md](./GENERIC-BOILERPLATE-README.md)

**If you choose Project-Specific:**
→ Read [README.md](./README.md)

**If you want to learn both:**
→ Read [INDEX-AND-GUIDE.md](./INDEX-AND-GUIDE.md)

## 💪 Key Insight

> Both boilerplates use the SAME architecture pattern.
>
> Generic: Shows the pattern with simple examples
> Project-Specific: Shows the pattern with complex real-world examples
>
> The difference is **complexity**, not **architecture**.

Pick the one that matches YOUR project complexity.
